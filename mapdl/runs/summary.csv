# Consolidated MAPDL run summary
# Lines starting with '#' are comments for human readers; CSV parsers should ignore them.
# Rows reported below: 40
# Values filled with '*' come directly from MAPDL and typically indicate missing data.
# Digest: 7165f0c5228d13d3112533d3c5c6a1974bfbb68fe43b6ae3c53c5e6b96ad102d
# Use `python summarize_runs.py --check-only` to verify this summary before relying on cached outputs.

# - n_theta                 : Number of lattice bays around the circumference (blank if pitch a_m was supplied).
# - tip_defl_m              : Tip deflection under the reference load case in metres.
# - buckling_factor         : Linear buckling eigenvalue relative to the reference axial load (1.0 means equal to reference load).
